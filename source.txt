			<h2>QrNim</h2>
			<h4>How to play:</h4>
			<p>Nim has been played since at least the 16<sup>th</sup> century, and in it's time has had many versions. This version, you pick how many you want to remove from the "pile", ether 1 though 3. The last person to collect all of the pieces of the pile wins. You go first, the bots move is calculated at the same time your move is displayed and calculated.</p>
